This is the website for my personal voice work, as well as links to my various vocal related projects.



This site is currently scaffolding, to be filled in with high-profile projects as they occur at a later date.

This serves as a sort of interactive business card; those who visit the site would generally already know who I am.

Â 

Those seeking business would typically click over to the Demo Reels/Services sections, and those who would be looking for the streams could find them on the front page.

It was suggested to me by my friend and digital artist (who likely will be the one to design the logo, art assets) to have the "above the fold" be the links in order of importance/monitisation. This generally would be the end point for the supporting viewer and is meant to reduce friction where possible.

Once the streaming project starts in earnest, links will be finalized, and a stream-highlights reel will be below the links, possibly besides the future official works sizzle reel.



Once domain names have been purchased and redirected, the official business name will be revealed.

\***CLAIRE** - **remember to clean up after class ends! What needs to be removed will be listed as added. CSS design elements can remain for future use.\***

-embedded video. Keep spot for your future video. 

-logo (replace with official when commissioned.)

-FontAwesome icon on services.html (was using .sparkles)
