        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My interest in voice work started from childhood, when my friends and I would attempt to mimic various
            Pok√©mon characters from the anime. I'm sure it was aggravating to any nearby adults, but it was quite fun!
        </p>
        <p>Since then I've dreamed of pointing out a character on screen to my friends and waggling my eyebrows at
            them, saying, "Recognise that voice?" and them responding, "...No..."
            <br>To me this indicates a job well done, and a future prank in the making!
        </p>
        <p>I am a lifelong enjoyer of all video games, large and small - the only exception being horror games in which
            I cannot fight back. Seriously, give me a single near-useless bullet and I'll give it a shot!</p>
        <p>I've completed several hundred games at this point and have been on a few world leaderboards, and I'm
            just getting started! Stop by my channels if you're in the mood for some gameplay!</p>

        <p>I'm always learning new things every day. If I'm not the perfect fit for your project right now, you can bet
            I'll be working to become a better fit down the road. I am happy to mould myself into the
            right fit for your project!</p>
        <p>Feel free to explore my demos or reach out - I'd love to bring your characters to life!</p>
